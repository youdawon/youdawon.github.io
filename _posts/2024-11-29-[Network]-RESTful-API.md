A RESTful API is an API that follows the principles of REST. It uses URIs to represent resources and allows interaction with those resources through standard HTTP method method like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. The goal is provide a simple, stable, and consistent way to build web services. 


RESTful API Principles

1. Resources = URIs
	1. Every resource is identified by a unique URI
2. Stateless
	1. Each client request is independent, and the server does not store the clientâ€™s state.
3. HTTP Methods = CRUD
	1. Use HTTP methods for actions such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

3. HTTP status codes

	1. The server responds with standards codes to indicate the result
