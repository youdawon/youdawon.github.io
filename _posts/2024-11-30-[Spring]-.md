1. IoC(Inversion of Control)
	1. The creation of object and lifecycle is managed by Spring Container, not by the developer.
2. DI(Dependency Injection)
	1. The String Container injects the required dependencies into an object automatically.
	2. It makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
3. The process
	1. Read Bean Definitions : Spring scans for Beans using annotations like @componet, @Bean
	2. Create Beans : Spring Container creates instances of the defined Beans.
	3. Injection Dependencies : During Bean creation, Spring automatically resolves and injects the required dependencies into the Beans.
	4. Manage Lifecycle : The Spring container manages the lifecycle of Bean objects including initialization and destruction.
